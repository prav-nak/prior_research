<p>A time-staggered partitioned coupling algorithm for transient heat conduction, P.B. Nakshatrala, K.B. Nakshatrala, D.A. Tortorelli</p>

<p>We present a time-staggered partitioned coupling algorithm for transient heat conduction
finite element simulations. This algorithm divides a large structural mesh into a number
of smaller subdomains, solves the individual subdomains separately and couples the solutions
to obtain the response to the original problem. The proposed algorithm is a mixed
multi-time-step algorithm and enables arbitrary time integration schemes and meshes to be
coupled with different timesteps in the various subdomains. In this procedure, the solution
of each partition is separately evaluated over a system timestep after which the interfacial
conditions are enforced making this a staggered algorithm which facilitates parallel computation.</p>

<p>The standard finite element weak form can be modified to include the jump terms and also by including an additional stabilization term as shown. The quantities in the angled brackets represent the averaged quantities over the interface and quantities in square brackets represent the jumps across the interface. Hence the weak form for parabolic systems now read:</p>

<p>Note that this formulation allows us to have nonconformingmeshes across the interface, i.e., the subdomain meshes can be created independently.</p>

<p><h4> Two-dimension example</h4></p>

<p>As an example, we partition the domain into 4 partitions as shown in Figure (a). We calculate the temperature field using standard Galerkin formulation and proposed discontinuous Galerkin formulation. The steady state response is shown below. For the stability and error analysis, refer the manuscript.

<p>Next, consider the same domain, but the conductivity as a function of temperature. This makes the problem nonlinear. For the same mesh shown in Figure (a), the transient response is as shown below. </p>

<p>The above formulation can be used for solid-liquid interface tracking. </p>
